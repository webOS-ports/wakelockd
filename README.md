wakelockd
=========

Summary
-------
Daemon controlling entering and leaving deep suspend.

Description
-----------
Android uses wakelocks to know when the device can enter a deep sleep mode. We have to
correctly handle and integrate this into the existing webOS system which doesn't know
anything about wakelocks. Therefor this daemon will be started by sleepd which will
then block until wakelockd exits. wakelockd will handle entering the suspend mode and
detect possibe wakeup reasons like power key pressed or an incoming telephony call.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute you can just start with cloning the repository and make your
contributions. We're using a pull-request based development and utilizing github for the
management of those. All developers must provide their contributions as pull-request and
github and at least one of the core developers needs to approve the pull-request before it
can be merged.

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Dependencies

Below are the tools and libraries (and their minimum versions) required to build
telephonyd:

* cmake (version required by openwebos/cmake-modules-webos)
* gcc 4.6.3
* glib-2.0 2.32.1
* make (any version)
* libevdev 1.0
* pkg-config 0.26

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`
when invoking `cmake`. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/openwebos ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of `$HOME/projects/openwebos`.

Specifying `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` also causes `pkg-config` to look in that tree
first before searching the standard locations. You can specify additional
directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

If not specified, `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that `cmake` has generated, enter:

    $ make help

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran `make install`, enter:

 $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.
